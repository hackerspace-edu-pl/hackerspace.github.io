        <p>Informacja:</p>
        <p>Niestety z powodu uporczywego nękania w miejscu gdzie mieszkamy i pracujemy nie będziemy kontynuować projektu. Tym samym odradzamy jakie kolwiek kontakty bądź wizyty w Jaworznie w. Śląskie.</p>
        <p>This project will be suspended due to the persistent harassment that has been occurring towards the project leaders as reported to cyber.gouv.fr, policja.pl, police.uk. We are being harassed even in our place of residence, which has resulted in the loss of financing and loss of our source of income as well as progressive damage to our health. It is clear to us that initiatives of this type are attacked for monopolistic reasons. Also we face corruption cases around which is killing non-profit projects. In the last few years we have witnessed open attacks on private individuals and businesses, where problems are artificially created and normal life is made impossible under made-up appearances. We therefore advise against any contact or visit to places like the city of Jaworzno in the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland but also several other places in Europe and Great Britain..</p>
